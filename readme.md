This game was designed for the sake of helping Grade 1's with their spelling. 

This game is unique due to the fact that unlike conventional hangman or spelling games its main focus is on flying a spaceship and shooting asteroids. 

The game starts when the "Play" button is clicked and ends when a players timer is 0 or when the required score is met. An instructions tab is availible on the main menu. 

The scoring system is based off of puzzles completed. 

Two player is the only gamemode availible and the winner of the two is decided by whos score is higher or whose timer doesnt reach zero first. 

Users know who won by a prompt at the end of the game. 

Given more time harder gamemodes including longer words, math, science, and moving asteroids along with varius other chanllenges would be added.
